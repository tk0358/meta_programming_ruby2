        # Evaluating many similar methods may use more memory as the instruction
        #  sequences are duplicated and cached (in MRI). define_method may
        # be slower on dispatch, but if you're careful about the closure
        # created, then defien_method will consume much less memory.

        # But sometimes the database might return columns with
        # characters that are not allowed in normal method names (like
        # 'my_column(omg)'. So to work around this we first define with
        # the __temp__ identifier, and then use alias method to rename
        # it to what we want.
        # 
        # We are also defining a constant to hold the frozen string of
        # the attribute name. Using a constant means that we do not have
        # to allocate an object on each call to the attribute method.
        # Making it frozen means that it doesn't get duped when used to
        # key the @attributes_cache in read_attribute.
